# Digit_Classification_usingSVM

You can run the file 'Handwritten_Digits_Classification.ipynb' in any python environment. 
In this project I am using SVM algorithm to classify digits from 0-9. I have developed 2 models, Linear and non-linear with non-linear giving better accuracy among the two. I have also performed Hyperparameter tuning on the non-linear model to improve the overall accuracy of the model.

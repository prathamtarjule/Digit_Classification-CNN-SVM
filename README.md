# Digit_Classification

In this project I am using SVM algorithm to classify digits from 0-9. I have developed 2 models, Linear and non-linear with non-linear giving better accuracy among the two. I have also performed Hyperparameter tuning on the non-linear model to improve the overall accuracy of the model.
I have now uploaded a second file which uses Deep CNN to classify the digits with a higher accuracy.
